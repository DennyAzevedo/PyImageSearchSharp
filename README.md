# PyImageSearch in C#
A collection of C# projects translated from [Adrian Rosebrock excellent python examples](http://www.pyimagesearch.com/) using OpenCV.

# Implemented projects
- [Document Scanner](9-1-2014-DocumentScanner)

This code was done as a learning experience, and provided as a guide for otheres. The code should be seen as an example, and not production ready. I have tried to keep the code similar to the original blog posts, rather than clean refactoring to make it clean C# code.
Pull requests welcome.
